# general-autoencoder
This repo contains an Antoencoder written in pytorch. It is designed to be as general as possible (hence the name): a template for other projects that requires little modification. 
`autoencoder.py`, `train.py` and `test.py` were written so that they should not need to be edited. `mnist.py` provides an example use case/proof that the model works.
